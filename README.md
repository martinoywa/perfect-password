# What is Perfect Password?
A minimalistic web application for Password Generation.

The appication was built durning the MLH New Year New Hack.

# Story

Password security is an increasing concern for most poeple as many companies
tend to ask their users to create new password over and over, and they require
that the new passwords are unique everytime.

Coming up with a new password that's unique is not easy, hence why most people
always gravitate towards reusing them. Perfec Password  is a stand alone and
minimalistic utility that can help users deal with this, by simply asking the
user how long they want their passwords to be, and how many passwords a user
wants to generate.

The reason why this tool only does this is because, most browsers if not all come with
their own built in password managers that most users are already familiar with and
tend to always use. So instead of building a fully functional password manager and
generator, I decided to stick to just a single functinoality, that will not extremely
alter a users mental model.
